### Document Model

The Document model represents uploaded documents in the e-signature workflow:

**Fields:**
- `id` (UUIDField): Unique identifier for the document (primary key)
- `owner` (ForeignKey): User who owns this document (related_name="documents")
- `file_url` (CharField): File path or S3 URL where the document is stored
- `file_name` (CharField): Original name of the uploaded file (max_length=255)
- `file_size` (IntegerField): Size of the file in bytes
- `status` (CharField): Current status with choices:
  - `draft`: Document is being prepared
  - `sent`: Document has been sent for signing
  - `completed`: Document has been fully signed
  - `rejected`: Document was rejected
- `created_at` (DateTimeField): Timestamp when the document was created
- `updated_at` (DateTimeField): Timestamp when the document was last updated

**Features:**
- Automatic UUID generation for document IDs
- Cascade delete when owner is deleted
- Default status of "draft"
- File size conversion to MB via `file_size_mb` property
- Admin interface with filtering and search capabilities

### Document Handling Dependencies
